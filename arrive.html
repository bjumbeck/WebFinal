                <h3>About this site</h3>
                This website was used for my final project in my web design course.
                I chose to create a website that hosts some of my favorite articles about steering behavior AI. 
                I have not written any of these articles and all credit for the articles content goes to their 
                writers which is listed above.

                Hopefully you enjoy some of these articles, if you do please check out the creators webpages
                which have even more for your enjoyment.

            <h2>Behavior: Arrive</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The <a href="index.html">seek </a> behavior, as we've seen, makes a character move towards a target. When it reaches the destination 
                    the steering force keeps acting on it based on the same rules, making the character "bounce" back and forth 
                    around the target.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The arrival behavior prevents the character from moving through the target. It makes the character 
                    slow down as it approaches the destination, eventually stopping at the target.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The behavior is composed of two phases. The first phase is when the character is far away from the target 
                    and it works exactly the same way as the seek behavior does (move at full speed towards the target). The second 
                    phase is when the character is close to the target, inside the "slowing area" (a circle centered at the target's position):
                </p>

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>When the character enters the circle, it slows down until it stops at the target.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Slowing Down</h3>

                <p>
                    When the character enters the slowing area its velocity is ramped down linearly to zero. This is achieved by 
                    adding a new steering force (the arrival force) to the character's velocity vector. The result of this addition 
                    will eventually become zero, meaning that nothing will be added to the character's position every frame 
                    (so there will be no movement):
                </p>

                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">// If (velocity + steering) equals zero, then there is no movement
velocity = truncate(velocity + steering, max_speed)
position = position + velocity
                         
function truncate(vector:Vector3D, max:Number) :void {
    var i :Number;
    i = max / vector.length;
    i = i < 1.0 ? i : 1.0;
    vector.scaleBy(i);
}</code></pre>

                <p>
                    In order to ensure the character will gradually slow down before it stops, the velocity should not become zero 
                    immediately. The gradual slow down process is calculated based on the radius of the slowing area and the distance 
                    between the character and the target:
                </p>

                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">// Calculate the desired velocity
desired_velocity = target - position
distance = length(desired_velocity)
 
// Check the distance to detect whether the character
// is inside the slowing area
if (distance < slowingRadius) {
    // Inside the slowing area
    desired_velocity = normalize(desired_velocity) * max_velocity * (distance / slowingRadius)
} else {
    // Outside the slowing area.
    desired_velocity = normalize(desired_velocity) * max_velocity
}
 
// Set the steering based on this
steering = desired_velocity - velocity</code></pre>

                <p>
                    If the distance is greater than slowingRadius, it means the character is far away from the 
                    target and its velocity should remain max_velocity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the distance is less than slowingRadius, it means the character has entered the slowing area and its 
                    velocity should be ramped down.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The term distance / slowingRadius will vary from 1 (when distance
                    equals slowingRadius) to 0 (when distance is almost zero). 
                    This linear variation will make the velocity smoothly slow down:
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="Resources\Images\steering_forces_arrival_slowing_down_factor.png">
                </figure>

                <p>As previously described, the character movement is performed as follows:</p>

                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">steering = desired_velocity - velocity
velocity = truncate (velocity + steering , max_speed)
position = position + velocity</code></pre>

                <p>
                    If the desired velocity is ramped down to zero, then the steering force becomes -velocity. As a consequence, when 
                    that steering force is added to the velocity, it will result in zero, making the character stop moving.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What the arrival behavior does, really, is calculate a force that will be equal to -velocity, preventing the character 
                    from moving as long as that force is in place. The character's original velocity vector does not change and it continues 
                    to work, but it is nulled by the steering addition. If the arrival steering force is lifted, the character will start moving again, 
                    using its original velocity vector.
