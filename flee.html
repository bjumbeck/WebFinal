                <h3>About this site</h3>
                This website was used for my final project in my web design course.
                I chose to create a website that hosts some of my favorite articles about steering behavior AI. 
                I have not written any of these articles and all credit for the articles content goes to their 
                writers which is listed above.

                Hopefully you enjoy some of these articles, if you do please check out the creators webpages
                which have even more for your enjoyment.

            <h2>Behavior: Flee</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The <a href="index.html">seek</a> behavior described previously is based on two forces that push 
                    the character towards the target: the desired velocity and the steering.
                </p>

                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">desired_velocity = normalize(target - position) * max_velocity
steering = desired_velocity - velocity</code></pre>

                <p>
                    The desired_velocity, in this case, is the shortest path between 
                    the character and the target. It is calculated by subtracting the target's position from the 
                    character's position. The result is a force vector that goes from the character towards the target.
                </p>

                    <img src="Resources\Images\steering_forces.png">
                    <figcaption>Seek behavior</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The flee behavior uses those same two forces, but they are adjusted to make the character run away from the target:
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="Resources\Images\steering_forces_flee.png">
                    <figcaption>Flee behavior</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    That new desired_velocity vector is calculated by subtracting the character's position 
                    from the target's position, which produces a vector that goes from the target towards the character. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The resulting forces are calculated almost the same way as in the seek behavior:
                </p>

                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">desired_velocity = normalize(position - target) * max_velocity
steering = desired_velocity - velocity</code></pre>

                <p>
                    The desired_velocity in that case represents the easiest escaping route the character 
                    can use to run away from the target. The steering force makes the character abandon its current route, pushing it 
                    towards the direction of the desired velocity vector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Comparing the desired velocity vector of the flee behavior with the desired velocity vector of the seek behavior, 
                    the following relation can be established:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-cpp">flee_desired_velocity = -seek_desired_velocity</code></pre>

                <p>In other words, one vector is the negative of the other.</p>

                <h3>Adding Escape Forces</h3>

                <p>
                    After the steering force is calculated it must be added to the character's velocity vector. Since that 
                    force is pushing the character away from the target, every frame the character will stop moving towards the 
                    target and start moving away from it, producing a flee path (the orange curve in the figure below):
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    The addition of those forces and the final velocity/position calculation are handled in the same way as
