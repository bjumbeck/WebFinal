                This website was used for my final project in my web design course.
                I chose to create a website that hosts some of my favorite articles about steering behavior AI. 
                I have not written any of these articles and all credit for the articles content goes to their 
                writers which is listed above.

            <h2>Behavior: Seek</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Steering behaviors aim to help autonomous characters move in a realistic manner, 
                    by using simple forces that are combined to produce life-like, improvisational 
                    navigation around the characters' environment. In this tutorial I will cover the 
                    basic theory behind the seek steering behavior, as well as its implementation.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The ideas behind these behaviors were proposed by <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig W. Reynolds</a>; 
                    they are not based on complex strategies involving path planning or global calculations, but instead 
                    use local information, such as neighbors' forces. This makes them simple to understand 
                    and implement, but still able to produce very complex movement patterns.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Position, Velocity and Movement</h3>
            
                <p>
                    The implementation of all forces involved in steering behaviors can be achieved using math vectors. 
                    Since those forces will influence the character's velocity and position, it's a good approach to use
                    vectors to represent them as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even though a vector has a direction, it will be ignored when related to position (let's assume the 
                    position vector is pointing to the character's current location).
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="Resources\Images\pos_velocity_vectors.png">
                    <figcaption>
                        The figure above represents a character positioned at (x, y) with a velocity (a, b). The movement 
                        is calculated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler integration:</a>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">position = position + velocity</code></pre>
            
                <p>
                    The direction of the velocity vector will control where the character is heading to while its length 
                    (or magnitude) will control how much it will move every frame. The greater the length, the faster 
                    the character moves. The velocity vector can be truncated to ensure it will not be greater than a 
                    certain value, usually max velocity.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The red square is moving towards a target (the mouse cursor). This movement pattern illustrates the 
                    seek behavior without any steering forces being applied so far. The green line represents the velocity 
                    vector, calculated as follows:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-cpp">velocity = normalize(target - position) * max_velocity</code></pre>

                <p>
                    It's important to notice that without the steering force, the character describes straight routes 
                    and it instantly changes its direction when the target moves, thus making an abrupt transition 
                    between the current route and the new one.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Calculating Forces</h3>
            
                <p>
                    If there was only the velocity force involved, the character would follow a straight line defined 
                    by the direction of that vector. One of the ideas of steering behaviors is to influence the character's 
                    movement by adding forces (called steering forces). Depending on those forces, the character will move 
                    in one or another direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the seek behavior, the addition of steering forces to the character every frame makes it smoothly 
                    adjust its velocity, avoiding sudden route changes. If the target moves, the character will gradually 
                    change its velocity vector, trying to reach the target at its new location.
                </p>
            
                <figure>
                    <figcaption>The seek behavior involves two forces: desired velocity and steering:</figcaption>
                    <img src="Resources\Images\steering_forces.png">
                </figure>
            
                <p>
                    The desired velocity is a force that guides the character towards its target using the shortest 
                    path possible (straight line between them - previously, this was the only force acting on the character). 
                    The steering force is the result of the desired velocity subtracted by the current velocity and it pushes 
                    the character towards the target as well. 
                </p>
            
                <P>
                    Those forces are calculated as follows:
                </P>
                
                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">desired_velocity = normalize(target - position) * max_velocity;
steering = desired_velocity - velocity</code></pre>

                <h3>Calculating Forces</h3>

                <p>
                    After the steering force has been calculated, it must be added to the character (it will be 
                    added to the velocity force). The addition of the steering  force to the velocity every frame 
                    will make the character smoothly abandon its old straight route and head towards the target, 
                    describing a seek path (orange curve in the figure below):
                </p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="Resources\Images\steering_forces_seek_path.png">
                </figure>

                <p>The addition of those forces and the final velocity/position calculation are:</p>

                <!-- Hate this line but couldn't figure out how to get the third party to format it properly with correct whitespace -->
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">steering = truncate(steering, max_force);
steering = steering / mass;
                         
velocity = truncate(velocity + steering , max_speed);
position = position + velocity;</code></pre>

                <p>
                    The steering force is truncated to ensure it will not exceed the amount of allowed forces 
                    the character can handle. Also the steering force is divided by the character mass, which 
                    produces different movement speeds for different weighted characters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every time the target moves, each character's desired velocity vector changes accordingly. 
                    The velocity vector, however, takes some time to change and start pointing at the target again. 
                    The result is a smooth movement transition.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>
                    Steering behaviors are great for creating realistic movement patterns. The main idea is to use 
                    local information to calculate and apply forces to create the behaviors. Even though the calculation 
                    is simple to implement, it is still able to produce very complex results.
